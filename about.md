# About Me

Hi, I’m Engincan Veske — a software engineer, open-source contributor, writer, and speaker. I love building high-quality, scalable applications, sharing knowledge, and exploring new technologies.

I currently work at Volosoft, where I develop enterprise-level solutions using .NET, cloud services, and modern architectural patterns. I’m also an active contributor to the ABP Framework, helping developers build modular and maintainable applications.
