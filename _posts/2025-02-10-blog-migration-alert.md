## 🚀 My Blog Has Moved to Substack!

I’m excited to announce that my personal blog has officially moved from GitHub Pages to **Substack**! 🎉

👉 **New URL:** [https://engincanveske.substack.com/](https://engincanveske.substack.com/)

### Why the Change?
Over time, I wanted a platform that makes it easier to engage with readers, manage content, and reach a wider audience. Substack provides:

- **Better reach & subscriptions** – Readers can subscribe to get updates directly in their inbox.
- **Improved writing experience** – A more streamlined way to publish and organize posts.
- **Community features** – More interaction and engagement with readers.

### What’s Next?
I will continue writing about **.NET, ABP Framework, cloud technologies, software architecture**, and my personal experiences in software development. If you enjoyed my content here, I’d love for you to **subscribe** on Substack to stay updated! 💡

Thank you for your support, and see you on Substack! 😊
