Attending the NDC London 2024 event was an amazing experience that left me with a wealth of knowledge and inspiration. It was my first time participating in such a big international software event gathering of software enthusiasts, and I am grateful for the opportunity.

In this article, I want to share my insights and takeaways from the event with the noteworthy talks that I attended. There were so many great talks, but since it's impossible to mention all of them, I will only mention a few that I attended and took notes from them. I intend to keep the article as short as possible and only share about my insights and takeaways. So, let's get started without any further ado!

## A Brief 2023 Highlights of ABP.IO Platform and Volosoft!

As a part of the open-source society, we are frequent sponsors of these kinds of events, organizing ABP Conferences, Community Talks, and more...

In 2023, we *sponsored* **5 events (NDC London 2023, Basta! Mains 2023, .NET Conf 2023 - just a few of them)**, *organized* **8 ABP Community Talks**, and also *organized* the [ABP .NET Conf'23](https://abp.io/conference/2023) (which is the first .NET Conf that we have organized).

With this mantra, in 2024, the first event that we have been sponsored became NDC London 2024. It's the 5th time in a row that we are being sponsored by NDC London. It's great to be a part of these kinds of events, communicate with software enthusiasts, and meet with new eager people from all around the world. We have so much to learn from each other...

There were lots of great talks, and we had a chance to talk with software enthusiasts and explain to them what <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/abpframework?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#abpframework</a> is and all of its capabilities! <a href="https://t.co/2QH347y6kw">pic.twitter.com/2QH347y6kw</a></p>&mdash; Engincan Veske (@EngincanVeske) <a href="https://twitter.com/EngincanVeske/status/1753385212543635809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I have spend 3 days with the team and it was all about chatting and having fun with amazing attendees and great speakers. We have met with passionate software developers, product owners, and software architects. Also, we had oppurtunity to introduce the [open source ABP Framework](https://github.com/abpframework/abp) and [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/) *-the complete web application development platform built on open source ABP Framework-*.

It was a pleasure to explain its features, benefits, and showcase its capabilities to an audience eager to explore innovative solutions in software development.

## Noteworthy Talks

NDC London featured an array of exceptional talks by industry experts. Some of the standout sessions that left a lasting impression on me included:

### 1-) Architecture Modernization: Aligning Software, Strategy, and Structure by Nick Tune

Nick Tune's presentation on Software Modernization provided valuable insights into the latest trends and best practices in adapting to the ever-evolving landscape of software development. His expertise and engaging delivery made this session particularly enlightening.

For example, I have learned a new term called **Wardley Mapping**, which is a way of visually mapping a business's structure to better understand the ecosystem in which the business it operates. 

It was a really good presentation and forced me to think about modernization in wide aspects.

### 2-) You Keep Using That Word: Asynchronous And Interprocess Comms by Sam Newman

In this talk, Sam Newman highlighted the truth that we don't have an exact definition for the word "Asynchronous", yes we define it with some words, but usually either they are wrong or they partly contain its real definition. 

He searched for a definition through his presentation, showed his previous tweets and their replies about how some developers tried to explain the word and went from top-to-bottom for a definite explanation.

It was a really good presentation and was really interesting to realize that we are unable to explain what we daily try to accomplish, which is **Asynchronous** Communication :)

End of the session, he clarified the terms and all of their meanings. It was a really interesting and informative talk.

### 3-) .NET gRPC - deep dive by Irina Scurtu

Irena Scuntu delved into the world of gRPC and explained it with example code blocks. It was a really practical presentation and she demonstrated the topic with simple yet informative examples and also mentioned some tips and options.

### 4-) What You Can Learn from an Open-Source Project with 300 Million Downloads by Dennis Doomen

Dennis Doomen's exploration of open-source projects with a staggering 300 million downloads was both fascinating and instructive. Uncovering the lessons and insights gained from such projects offered valuable takeaways for developers striving to contribute to and learn from the open-source community.

In his talk, he shared invaluable tools and techniques that he has been using and how they've enriched his daily productivity. He talked in a pretty wide range, from naming conventions to build scripts or API approval to automated testing and so on. It was really informative and I took so many notes from his slides.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, my experience at NDC London was nothing short of extraordinary. The event not only provided a platform to share the innovations of the ABP Framework but also exposed me to a wealth of knowledge through the exceptional talks delivered by industry leaders. I look forward to future opportunities to engage with the vibrant software development community.

Also, I want to express my gratitude to my company [Volosoft](https://volosoft.com/) for this great privilege and opportunity.

Thanks for reading :)
